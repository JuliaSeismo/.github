## Hi there üëã

# Introduction

JuliaSeismo aims to be a GitHub organization for Julia packages in various seismological applications. 
One of our goals is to deliver robust packages developed by single authors into community-maintained packages. 
A second goal is to provide a unified ecosystem within which Julia packages will be interoperable.
A code package stems from [SeisIO](https://github.com/jpjones76/SeisIO.jl), which we converted to [SeisBase.jl](https://github.com/JuliaSeismo/SeisBase.jl) in order to allow the community to maintain the package when issues arise.

To date (11/15/2023), the packages are used for large-scale seismic processing in ambient seismic field studies (SeisNoise).

We hope the JuliaSeismo organization and community will grow as big data needs arise in seismological research.

# üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources

Some of the packages maintained by the organization are published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
